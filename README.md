# Planning

## Database
 - Start with the database
 - Draw out your tables in words.
 - Create the schema!
 - Write the SQL to create your tables!
 - Considerations: foreign/primary keys, data types...


## Wireframe
- Lofi wireframes for each part of your app
- Possibly design mobile first?

## Break up your task into 20ish minute chunks, then have a little break 

## Lock in your MVP features early 
- Rewrite the MVP features from teh assignment requirements?
- What are the smallest building blocks of each different feature, start by implementing those! 

## Main requirements
- Routes! Static ones AND dynamic ones
    - building blocks would be configuring your routes to match your plan
- Rendering db data
    - configure your DB connection
    - Test your DB connection, seed? Postman?
- Sending data to the db
    - configure your DB connection
    - Test your DB connection, seed? Postman?
